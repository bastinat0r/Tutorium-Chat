Dependencies: Erlang.

To compile use "make".

To work start scripts correctly you must add to your
$ERL_LIBS variable the way to Tutorium-Chat.
Add to <Home>/.profile this configuration:
"ERL_LIBS="$HOME/<Path to Tutorium Chat>/Tutorium-Chat
 export ERL_LIBS"

Starting server: escript server
Starting client: escript client

It is possible to configure client 
- escript client <IP> <Port>
- escript client <Port>
for example for java server: escript client 8080

Commands that possible to use by client:

/nick Nickname -> change a Nickname (client change name and erlang server option)
/room Roomname -> change a RoomName (erlang server option)
/exit -> close client shell         (client option)

ignore and delete erl_crash.dump (I will change it later)
