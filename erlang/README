Dependencies: Erlang.

To compile use "make".

To work start scripts correctly you must add to your
$ERL_LIBS variable the way to Tutorium-Chat.
Add to <Home>/.profile this configuration:
"ERL_LIBS="$HOME/<Path to Tutorium Chat>/Tutorium-Chat
 export ERL_LIBS"

Starting server: escript server
Server starting standart on port 5555
Starting client: escript client (server must be started at first)
Client tries to connect to localhost on port 5555

It is possible to configure server
- escript client <Port>

It is possible to configure client
- escript client <IP> <Port>
- escript client <Port>
for example for java server: escript client 8080

Commands that possible to use by client:

/nick Nickname  -> change a Nickname (client change name and erlang server option)
/room Roomname  -> change a RoomName (erlang server option)
/list rooms     -> list all rooms on server
/list users     -> list all users in rooms
/exit           -> close client shell         (client option)

ignore and delete erl_crash.dump (I will change it later)
